If you go and look for recycling businesses you get flooded with the ♻️ symbols, leaves and bright greenish colors. We wanted to move away from that, I went for other ways to differentiate and represent it. Taking references from the main focus of the company, tires, I took advantage of the name as is already very descriptive, so I opted for something subtle and abstract.

I came up with a round shape representing a tire, they’re similar figures around in a disorderly manner, symbolizing the pollution and waste. RIM joins them and makes them as one, in something useful and newly represented in the center.

They also needed a strong and elegant mark to be used alone or accompanied by the symbol without losing its identity. I connect the acronyms of the name, in a way, recycling the “i” letter as part of the ”M” to become clear, simple and memorable.

Now, the website wasn't complicated at all, they just needed a basic one with their information and show ways to be contacted. It fallows the brand simpleness with clear and concise text, few colors and good photos to end with an elegant and straightforward site.
